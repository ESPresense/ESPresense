## [2.0.5]

- [Fix for panic](https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino/pull/304)

## [2.0.4]

- [Fix for panic](https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino/issues/302)

## [2.0.3]

- Don't Query until device rssi > -90dBm
- Query forever w/ exponential backoff (retry after maxes at 1m)
- New name fingerprint for macbooks
- Query: use max power for all connections

## [2.0.2]

- Don't Query until device is <= maxDistance

## [2.0.1]

- Query bugs squashed! Needs a bit more testing, but it's MUCH better than 2.0
- Apple model fingerprint updated to apple:model (with the , turned into a -)
- BH1750 sensor support added [lux sensor](https://amzn.to/3AoKlQ4)

## [2.0.0]

- Add `Query` switch to mqtt and webapp setup (defaults to off so as to not break existing fingerprints)
- Add `Active Scan` switch to mqtt and webapp setup
- Add device model to apple fingerprints
- Add support [room assistant app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/room-assistant/id1538642237?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) @DTTerastar (#69)
- Stats reworked

## [1.7.3]

- Skip distance was being ignored because of an accidental cast to int @DTTerastar (#75)

## [1.7.2]

- Fix MQTT last will and testament not consistently sending offline

## [1.7.1]

- Fix more places slugified room name is needed

## [1.7.0]

- Potientaly breaking: room name is now lower cased, trimmed, and all whitespace replaced with underscores when put into mqtt (#64)
- ANSI Colors Added to Serial
- Close/Left totally rewritten to find stuff quickly (uses NO filtering)
- Serial display for 'New' waits for 2nd packet before showing
- One Euro filter reoptimized to work for slow broadcasters (Tiles) as well as it previously did for quick (Phones/Watches)
- All time measurement made wraparound protected
- Make Arduino OTA disabled by default, but a setting
- Add a calibration section of settings with lots of knobs to twiddle
- Ignore microsoft and non Nearby Info apple packets (they are useless for tracking atm)
- Delete old fingerprints after configurable max age instead of waiting for MAX MACS and deleting the oldest

## [1.6.4]

- Fix malformed discovery json

## [1.6.3]

- Add an adafruit-huzzah32 flavor
- Add md logging to verbose (#63)

## [1.6.2]

- Fixing a failed update keeping scanning off
- Max distance now allows decimals to 2 places

## [1.6.1]

- Replaced NOUPDATE flavor with an autoupdate preference (#50)
- Add Macchina A0 flavor with battery mv reading (#51)

## [1.6.0]

- Web portal works after wifi connection details established (#13)
- PIR and Radar Motion sensors supported via configurable GPIO pins (#48)

## [1.5.5]

- Misc GUI fixes for m5stickc
- Max distance settable via MQTT /max_distance/set
- Make active scanning optional (can help battery life on certain devices)
- Optional HA Auto Discovery (fix #16)

## [1.5.4]

- Fix beacons that send BOTH manufacture data and service uuids (#41)

## [1.5.3]

- Fix m5stickc init flag

## [1.5.2]

- Fix Close message not being logged out serial
- Don't trust inaccurate Apple txPower

## [1.5.1]

- Breaking Change: iBeacon id's were backwards, they are now correct and match HA Companion
- Bump NimBLE to 1.3.1
- Add support for blinking m5atom led, red=no wifi, blue=no mqtt, blinking white is packet seen
- Fix rssi@1m when multiple packets from same mac

## [1.5.0]

- Nothing changed, intended changes are in 1.5.1

## [1.4.4]

- Additional sonos fingerprinting
- Remove button handling from esp32 flavors (#34)

## [1.4.3]

- Add mifit fingerprint

## [1.4.2]

- Fix fingerprinting of KeySmart tiles

## [1.4.1]

- Fix errant voltage reporting

## [1.4.0]

- Fingerprints are now 3 tier: primary ids > publicMac > secondard ids.  A single mac can have multiple advertisements sent (especially certain beacons).  So it might take a few packets before the id settles into the correct one.
- Volts and temperature are now reported from Eddystone TLM advertisements
- Names should show up more reliably now as well

## [1.3.1]

- Turn off NTP by default

## [1.3.0]

- More changes to fingerprinting, id will be different if the device is sonos or samsung.  Those instead of saying md:<id> now use the manufacture name (samsung or sonos) as the prefix with the mac at the end
- Windows 10 we fingerprint as microsoft:<last 23 bytes in hex of manufacture data>. See https://petsymposium.org/2019/files/papers/issue3/popets-2019-0036.pdf for why, still not useful for a consistent fingerprint

## [1.2.0]

- Prefer mac address as ID if we have a static MAC and only md fingerprint
- Breaking: If you're using a md:*:* fingerprint, verify that it hasn't switched to the mac

## [1.1.2]

- Add support for clearing wifi setting via button on DevKit (as long as it's on GPIO15)

## [1.1.1]

- Fix fingerprinting of udm-pro
- Fix semaphore error

## [1.1.0]

- Go back to active scanning by default (so we can get the names of things)
- Send telemetry only every 15s
- Allow for disabling types of mqtt topics
- M5Sticks now have a UI showing devices that are close

## [1.0.1]

- Added esp32-noupdate

## [1.0.0] - 2021-08-20

- Initial
